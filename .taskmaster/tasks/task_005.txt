# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Invite Code Entry System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the invite code entry system with validation, success and error states as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create an input field component with the placeholder "Enter exclusive invite code"
2. Implement client-side validation with appropriate error handling
3. Add visual feedback for different states:
   - Success state: Green glow effect
   - Error state: Red text "Invalid invite code - try again"
4. Store valid invite codes in PostgreSQL database
5. Create an API endpoint for validating invite codes
6. Implement form submission handling with proper error management
7. Add appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility

# Test Strategy:
Test the invite code validation with valid and invalid codes. Verify that the success and error states display correctly. Test the form submission with network throttling to ensure good UX during slow connections. Validate the accessibility of the form elements.
