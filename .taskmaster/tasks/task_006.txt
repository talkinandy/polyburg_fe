# Description: Implement the primary call-to-action button with different states and deep linking to Telegram.
# Details:
1. Create a reusable CTA button component with the following states:
   - Disabled: Grayed out before valid code entry
   - Enabled: Bright green with pulsing glow effect
   - Hover: Intensified glow
2. Implement the button text: "Launch Polyburg Terminal â†’"
3. Add deep linking functionality to `https://t.me/polyburgbot?start=[invite_code]`
4. Ensure the button is only enabled after successful invite code validation
